git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new validation rule for input sanitization"
```

git push origin feat/your-feature-name
```

Then open a Pull Request on the main repository against the `main` branch.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- pip or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/agent-governance-kit.git
cd agent-governance-kit

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows

# Install in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs all runtime dependencies plus development tools including `pytest`, `ruff`, and type checkers.

---

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest

# Run with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run a specific test file
pytest tests/test_core.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=agent_governance_kit --cov-report=term-missing
```

All tests must pass before a Pull Request can be merged. Aim for clear, focused test cases that validate both expected behavior and edge cases.

---

## Code Style

This project enforces consistent formatting and linting using [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff).

### Formatting

```bash
# Auto-format all files
ruff format .

# Check formatting without modifying files
ruff format --check .
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run linter and auto-fix issues
ruff check --fix .

# Check without modifying files
ruff check .
```

### Guidelines

- Use type hints for all public functions and methods.
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines where practical.
- Prefer explicit names over abbreviations.
- Follow PEP 8 conventions unless otherwise specified.
- Write docstrings for all public APIs (Google or NumPy style).

## Commit Messages

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Every commit message must be structured as follows:

```
<type>(<scope>): <description>
```

### Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `feat` | A new feature |
| `fix` | A bug fix |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes |
| `style` | Code style changes (formatting, no logic change) |
| `refactor` | Code refactoring without behavior change |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore` | Maintenance tasks, CI/CD, tooling |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |
| `build` | Changes to build system or dependencies |

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 token refresh mechanism
fix(cache): resolve race condition in concurrent eviction
docs: update installation guide for Windows users
test(core): add edge case tests for input validation
```

### Rules

- Use the imperative mood ("add" not "added" or "adds").
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters.
- Use the body to explain *what* and *why*, not *how*.
- Reference issues in the body: `Closes #42`.

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
2. Run the full test suite and verify all tests pass.
3. Run `ruff format` and `ruff check` with no errors.
4. Review your own PR as if you were a reviewer.

### PR Description

Use the provided PR template. Include:

- **Summary**: A concise description of what changed.
- **Motivation**: Why the change is needed.
- **Testing**: How the change was tested.
- **Screenshots**: If applicable, for UI changes.
- **Related Issues**: Link to related issues using `Closes #`, `Fixes #`, or `Relates to #`.

### Review Process

- All PRs require at least one approval before merging.
- Maintainers may request changes or ask clarifying questions.
- Address all feedback, then re-request review.
- Keep the PR focused — one logical change per PR.

### Merging

- PRs are squash-merged to maintain a clean commit history.
- The PR title becomes the commit message — ensure it follows Conventional Commits.
